# ASCII-Hex-Decimal-Binary-Conversion
This was a C++ program that I made in January 2021 that allowed the user to convert different types of numbers. 
I developed this in Visual Studio and using an older version of C++ so it may not work on modern compilers.
For those who want to check it out "Conversion.cpp" is the file with the main function. 
The exe file is available to show how the final product of the C++ files would run.
